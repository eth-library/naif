The initiative aims to strengthen interoperability, standardisation, and coordination across the country’s research information ecosystem.\nThe survey explores how repositories are managed, described, and sustained, focusing on infrastructure, metadata practices, governance, and long-term strategies. It seeks to identify common strengths, gaps, and challenges, laying the groundwork for a national roadmap aligned with international standards and open science principles.\nThe questionnaire is addressed to repository managers and service leads from Swiss higher education institutions operating repositories or CRIS systems. Each manager will be contacted directly to participate.\nTo support respondents, two Q&A sessions will be organised:\n\n🇫🇷 Thursday, 20 November 2025, 11:00–12:00 (in French)\n\n🇩🇪 Wednesday, 26 November 2025, 15:00–16:00 (in German)\n\nThe survey draws inspiration from major international efforts, including the NORF Survey of Open Repositories in Ireland, the OpenAIRE / LIBER / SPARC Europe / COAR Joint Survey of Open Repositories in Europe, the COAR consultation “Crafting a Vision for European Repositories”, and the institutional repository workflow survey carried out within the Working Group 2 (Taskforce 1: Metadata in Institutional Repositories) of the Barcelona Declaration on Open Research Information.\nThis will be the first national overview of repository maturity and practices in Switzerland. Findings will inform coordinated actions and shared services, and aggregated results will be published openly on Zenodo within the NAIF community — contributing to a stronger and more connected Swiss open science ecosystem.\nDeadline: 15 December 2025\nContact: naif-survey@library.ethz.ch\nTake the survey: https://www.surveyhero.com/c/naif-repositories-2025\n\n\nNAIF Workshop on the responsible use of Quantitative Scientometric Indicators\n31.10.2025\nOn 11th of September 2025, a NAIF Workshop on the responsible use of Quantitative Scientometric Indicators (QSI) was held at ETH Zurich in the context of the 6th SYoS (Swiss Year of Scientometrics) Workshop.\nThe slides of a lightning talk by Ginny Barbour, Co-Chair of the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), on Using Quantitative Indicators Responsibly in Research Assessment are now available on Zenodo.\nA summary of the workshop and its insights by Martin Jaekel is available on the SYoS Blog.\n\n\nNAIF at the SOAD Day and at the ICSTI 2025 Annual conference\n26.09.2025\nThe month of September is marked by a series of events dedicated to Open Science, and we are proud to have contributed to the momentum.

    "section": "Project description",
    "text": "Project description\nCompared to other countries, Switzerland lacks a systematic overview of the output (e.g., scientific publications) produced by researchers at Swiss Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Most institutions have their own repositories in which a large number of their publications are listed. However, these repositories differ in coverage of the institutional research outputs and completeness of metadata for the available publications. An Open Access (OA) monitor has been implemented in Switzerland, which provides a rough overview of the distribution of OA publications, amongst other things. While the implementation of this monitor was a step in the right direction, it does not allow standardized data analysis beyond answering simple questions. In sum, little information and data are available on research conducted at Swiss HEIs, with the consequence that Swiss research is less visible and Swiss policymakers still rely on traditional university rankings and external data providers for monitoring and steering, rather than consulting standardized, high-quality information provided by local HEIs. The project aims (1) to make research outputs by researchers at Swiss HEIs more visible, and (2) to optimize the data basis for monitoring and steering Swiss research in general and OA publications in particular. To achieve these overarching goals, the project will work towards more standardization and interoperability across repositories in Swiss HEIs and develop scenarios for a national approach to disseminate and reuse Swiss research results. In addition, the project aims (3) to promote the responsible use of indicators for research assessment on the basis of the national approach and standardized repositories.\nThe project aims to create a basis for a national approach that considers both conceptual requirements and technical requirements. The project is divided in four tracks accompanied by a unified outcome providing a foundation for a national approach that is aligned with current trends in research assessment and open science practices, and a thorough understanding of the key factors that ensure the dissemination (i.e., integration of national output in global ecosystems) and findability (i.e., high-quality metadata) of the research outputs deposited in Swiss institutional repositories."

In particular, with the responsible use of quantitative indicators we seek a way that is compliant with the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) and the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA), and that takes into account current international trends in open science. Our work should help to prioritize standardization of metadata in repositories. We will involve participants of Swiss Year of Scientometrics (SYoS). SYoS brought together a community of experts from different organisations and at different levels to discuss research assessments, bibliometric methods and open science practices. An active participation of the Center for Higher Education and Science Studies (CHESS) is planned as well. We will also try to reach out to the CoARA Working group on Responsible Metrics and Indicators (RMI) to further strengthen connections with CoARA.\n\n\nTrack 2: Review of national approaches and development of scenarios for Switzerland\nResponsible partners: University of Zurich, ETH Zurich\nThis track will start with a structured, collaborative workshop format, inviting experts from countries with similar but also different frameworks to share insights and experiences. The workshop will facilitate a comparative analysis of national strategies. The focus will be on key governmental and institutional stakeholders, funding mechanisms, sustainability models, cost-effectiveness and technical solutions (e.g. federated vs. centralised systems). The findings will be reviewed to identify gaps and challenges specific to Switzerland. Then, engaging key national stakeholders will be essential to identify requirements, expectations, and challenges through consultations including roundtables and white papers. Based on these insights, a well-founded proposal will be drafted and refined in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders to ensure its feasibility and long-term success. Moreover, the introduction of a secondary publication right will be taken into account."

The starting point will be a list of institutional repositories from institutions that are accredited by swissuniversities. Such an inventory aims to provide an in-depth analysis of repositories, and can be seen as a systematic extension of the broad overview given through the list of participating institutions in the Swiss Open Access Monitor. Part of these repositories will be investigated in terms of (a) already implemented standards and certifications (e.g., OpenAIRE guidelines, CoreTrustSeal) as well as repository software currently in use, (b) metadata availability, quality, and completeness, evaluating their alignment with international best practices (e.g., OpenAIRE, Dublin Core, DataCite), (c) technical requirements identifying existing barriers to seamless data exchange and integration. Because of the heterogeneity of the current landscape and the number of institutions (50+), some parts of the inventory may focus on a subset of institutions whose selection will partly depend on institutions’ willingness to participate. Once the inventory has been completed, a report featuring the results of the gap analysis will be prepared. The report will help to determine common denominators among institutional repositories to assess the feasibility of metadata harmonization. It may also provide feasible recommendations to enhance alignment with national and international frameworks (e.g., OpenAIRE guidelines), help building a shared and standardized metadata framework that takes the characteristics of Switzerland into account.\n\n\nTrack 4: Enhancement of national and global academic data\nResponsible partners: ETH Zurich, EPFL\nThis track focuses on data that have already been, or that will be, integrated into institutional repositories, but that are sourced elsewhere, such as identifiers for Swiss organizations (e.g., ROR), researchers active in Switzerland (e.g., ORCID), funding information for Swiss or international projects and OA information (OA type, document version, embargo, APCs). A workshop and a virtual session will gather stakeholders to determine which academic data are relevant, and which measures or actions could be taken to improve their findability or their quality. The workshop and the virtual session will also determine the selection of measures or actions that will be implemented. These translate into deliverables that could consist in guidelines or in concrete actions such as the establishment of a mapping of Swiss organizations or an authoritative list of researchers active in the country.\n\n\nUnified outcome: Creation of a working group\nResponsible partners: ETH Zurich, EPFL, ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences, University of Zurich\nThis unified outcome aims to establish a working group that will make advancements towards more interoperability and standardization across institutional repositories in Switzerland. Using the preliminary findings of the conceptual requirements identified by the tracks responsible use of quantitative indicators and review of national approaches and development of scenarios for Switzerland as well as the technical recommendations of the tracks survey and analysis of Swiss institutional repositories and enhancement of national and global academic data, project participants will define the status of the working group, its organizational form, criteria of representativity, as well as goals, strategy, and actions to enhance the visibility of Swiss research results and to ensure smooth data dissemination."
